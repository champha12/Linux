# Account Setup
1. I began by creating a Microsoft Azure account using the email address provided by my university.
2. Next, I familiarized myself with cloud computing and its significance.
3. I also explored the benefits available to students and opened a student account, which granted me $100 in credits to use for purchasing any package within the Azure environment.
# Creating a Virtual Machine
1. I set up a virtual machine to work on later in the course.
2. I selected Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS Gen 2, published by Canonical, from the Azure Marketplace.
3. The machine was named "lab-robotics".
4. For the configuration, I opted for the Standard_B2ls_v2 instance from the B-series.
5. Additionally, I created a new resource group and a subnet to host the virtual machine.
# Linking My HAMK Email to GitHub
I created a new repository named "linux" for the assignment.
Then, I added my HAMK email as a secondary email address for version control.
